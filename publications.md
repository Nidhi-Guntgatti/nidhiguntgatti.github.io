1. This study leverages high-fidelity duplex sequencing on sequential sperm samples from 23 donors—collected over spans of 10 to 33 years—to directly measure how individual germline mutation rates increase with age. We found that while mutation burdens grow over time, clonal mutations established early in development remain stable, hinting at a preserved spermatogonial stem cell pool. These insights not only align with previous trio-based studies but also offer groundbreaking perspectives on aging-related mutation processes in the male germline.

2. This study reports the discovery of a novel Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and motile bacterium—SYSU G01003T—isolated from sediment in a tepid spring in Tengchong, Yunnan, China. The strain grows best at 37 °C and pH 7.0, tolerating up to 2.5% NaCl. Detailed chemotaxonomic analysis reveals unique features such as meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall, MK-7 as its sole respiratory quinone, and a distinct fatty acid profile. Genomic analysis, with a G + C content of 54.0 mol%, and average nucleotide identity values below the species threshold compared to Paenibacillus azotifigens, confirm that SYSU G01003T represents a new species. We propose the name Paenibacillus yunnanensis sp. nov. for this bacterium
